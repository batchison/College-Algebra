{\bf I - Motivating Example(s):}\\
\par
Whenever we are asked to find when a rational expression or function $f$ is positive, negative, $\geq 0$, or $\leq 0,$ we can always apply the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify a complete factorization of the expression.
	\item Construct a sign diagram.
	\item Find all intervals that correspond to the desired inequality.
	\item In the case of $\geq$ or $\leq,$ make sure to include any $x-$intercepts.
\end{enumerate}
Solve the inequality $f(x)>0$ for the following function.
$$f(x)=\dfrac{-2x^3+6x^2+18x-54}{3x^3+12x^2-33x+18}$$
Using \Desmos \ to graph our function, we can see that our answer should be $(-6,-3)$.  To reach this result algebraically, we will need to find a factored form for $f$ in order to construct a sign diagram.  Using our prerequisite knowledge from factoring polynomials, specifically the Rational Root Theorem, one can obtain the following factorization.
$$f(x)=\frac{-2(x+3)(x-3)^2}{3(x+6)(x-1)^2}$$
To find the sign diagram for $f,$ we need to identify our $x-$intercepts, as well as those $x$ not in the domain.  From our factorization, we see that this is the set $x=\{-6,-3,1,3\},$ with $x\pm3$ being our intercepts.
\newpage
Our diagram is shown below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale=1,yscale=1]
	\draw [<->](-8.25,0) -- coordinate (x axis mid) (5.25,0) node[below right] {$x$};
	\draw [-, dashed](-6,1) -- coordinate (y axis mid) (-6,-0.25) node[below] {$-6$};
	\draw [-](-3,1) -- coordinate (y axis mid) (-3,-0.25) node[below] {$-3$};
	\draw [-](3,1) -- coordinate (y axis mid) (3,-0.25) node[below] {$3$};
	\draw [-, dashed](1,1) -- coordinate (y axis mid) (1,-0.25) node[below] {$1$};
	\draw (-7,-1) node {$x=-7$};
	\draw (-4.5,-1) node {$x=-5$};
	\draw (-1,-1) node {$x=0$};
	\draw (2,-1) node {$x=2$};
	\draw (4,-1) node {$x=4$};
	\draw (-7,0.5) node {$-$};
	\draw (-4.5,0.5) node {$+$};
	\draw (-1,0.5) node {$-$};
	\draw (2,0.5) node {$-$};
	\draw (4,0.5) node {$-$};
	\draw (-7,-1.75) node {\footnotesize $\dfrac{(-)(-)}{(+)(-)}$};
	\draw (-4.5,-1.75) node {\footnotesize $\dfrac{(-)(-)}{(+)(+)}$};
	\draw (-1,-1.75) node {\footnotesize $\dfrac{(-)(+)}{(+)(+)}$};
	\draw (2,-1.75) node {\footnotesize $\dfrac{(-)(+)}{(+)(+)}$};
	\draw (4,-1.75) node {\footnotesize $\dfrac{(-)(+)}{(+)(+)}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
One important observation in our diagram is in the calculation of each sign.  For each test value, we have excluded the {\it squared} factors in the numerator and denominator, since both $(x-3)^2$ and $(x-1)^2$ will always contribute a positive sign and not affect the end result.  For example, when $x=0,$ we get $$\dfrac{(-)(+)(-)^2}{(+)(+)(-)^2},$$ which reduces to the result that we see above.  Similarly, we could have excluded the $(+)$ that appears in the denominator of each test value's sign calculation, since the constant multiplier of $3$ will have no impact on sign.\\
\ \par
At this point we are essentially done, since the factorization and construction of our diagram has done the bulk of the work for us.  Since we are asked to find all $x$ such that $f(x)>0,$ we see that this equals to the union of all intervals that correspond to a $+$ sign.  This gives us our anticipated answer of $(-6,-3)$.\\
\ \par
Recalling our discussion of the last example, if we wished to answer the follow-up question of when $f(x)\geq 0,$ we would just need to include all boundary values in our diagram that correspond to $x-$intercepts (when $f(x)=0$).  From our diagram, this would be any value of $x$ that has a {\it solid} divider, remembering that dashed dividers correspond to values not in our domain.  In this case, the function $f(x)\geq 0$ for all $x$ in the set $(-6,-3]\cup\{3\}$.\\
