\normalsize This course pack contains lesson handouts for 
%the first half of
College Algebra.  Each lesson follows closely with its respective section/subsection in the accompanying course textbook, available in Blackboard.  Each lesson will be discussed during in-class lectures and/or labs, and consequently should be brought to class.  All lessons are also be available in Blackboard.\\
\par
{\bf IMPORTANT:} Each lesson should be treated as a {\it secondary} resource to the course textbook, which offers more detailed explanations and additional worked out examples.  In the event that you feel that a particular lesson does not provide enough insight or instruction regarding a particular topic, you should find that the accompanying textbook content will help to clarify things for more a complete understanding.  {\bf It is therefore expected that all students utilize the course textbook regularly,} alongside any course notes, lessons, and additional handouts.\\
\par
Although largely free of mathematical errors and ``typos'', students who identify any errors/typos in either the lessons or textbook are encouraged to report them to the instructor, and the reporting of any mathematical errors will be rewarded with small incentives in the form of additional course homework, quiz, or exam points.
