\normalsize This textbook is designed as the primary resource for instruction of a traditional College Algebra course at
Framingham State University. 
Each section follows closely with its respective lesson(s) in the accompanying course pack, but offers more detailed explanations and additional worked out examples.\\
\par
Although largely free of mathematical errors and ``typos'', students who identify any errors/typos in either the textbook or course pack are encouraged to report them to the instructor, and the reporting of any mathematical errors will be rewarded with small incentives in the form of additional course homework, quiz, or exam points.
