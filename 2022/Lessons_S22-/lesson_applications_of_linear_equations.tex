{\bf Lesson:}
\par
We will encounter several key phrases when solving application problems.  These include the following.
\begin{itemize}
  \item A {\it number,} unknown, integer value, etc. often becomes our variable ($x,y,t,\ldots$).  
  \item {\it Is,} was, will be, are, etc. often represents equals, $=$.
  \item {\it More than} often implies addition, and is usually built backwards, writing the second part plus the first.
  \item {\it Less than} often implies subtraction and is usually built backwards, writing the second part minus the first.
\end{itemize}
{\bf Example:} An integer ($x$) is 3 less than another integer ($y$).
$$x=y-3$$
{\bf I - Motivating Example(s):}\\

Solving age problems can be summarized in the following five steps. These five
steps are guidelines to help organize the problem we are trying to solve.
\[%\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    & \mbox{Age~Now} & \mbox{Change}\\
    \hline
    \mbox{Person~1} &  & \\
    \hline
    \mbox{Person~2} &  & \\
    \hline
  \end{array} \]
\begin{enumerate}
\newpage
  \item Fill in the `Age Now' column; the age of the person we know nothing about is $x$.
  
  \item Fill in the future/past column by adding/subtracting the change to
  the `Age Now' column.
  
  \item Make an equation for the relationship in the future. This is
  independent of the table.
  
  \item Replace variables in the equation with information in the future/past cells of table.
  
  \item Solve the equation for $x$, use the solution to answer the question.
\end{enumerate}
{\bf Example:} Adam is 20 years younger than Brian. In two years Brian will be twice as
  old as Adam. How old are they now?
    \begin{multicols}{2}
		Let $x$ represent Brian's age now.\\
		Then $x-20$ represent's Adam's age now.\\
		Fill in the table accordingly.
		
		\columnbreak
		
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      & \text{Age Now} & $+ 2$\\
      \hline
      \text{Adam} & $x-20$ & $(x-20)+2$\\
      \hline
      \text{Brian} & $x$ & $x+2$\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{multicols}
In two years, we know that Brian's age will be twice Adam's age.  Using our table, this gives us the following equation and solution.
		\begin{eqnarray*}
		B & = & 2A\\
		x+2 & = & 2(x-18)\\
		x+2 & = & 2x-36\\
    2 & = & x-36\\
    x & = & 38
		\end{eqnarray*}
Hence, Brian is $38$ years old, and Adam is $38-20=18$ years old.  A simple check confirms our answer.  In two years, Brian will be 40 and Adam will be 20.\\
\par
When solving distance, rate, and time problems we will use the relationship $r\cdot t = d$ or rate times time equals distance. For example, if a person were to travel 30 mph (miles per hour) for 4 hours, to find the total distance we would multiply the rate times time to produce a distance of $30\text{mph}\cdot 4\text{hrs} = 120\text{miles}$.  As with age problems, we use a table to keep the problem organized.
\[%\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    & \mbox{Rate} & \mbox{Time} & \mbox{Distance}\\
    \hline
    \mbox{Person~1} &  &  & \\
    \hline
    \mbox{Person~2} &  &  & \\
    \hline
  \end{array} 
\]
	
The `Distance' column, will always be filled in by multiplying the `Rate'
and `Time' columns together. If we are given a total distance of both persons or
trips we will put this information below the distance column.\\

{\bf Example:} Two joggers start from opposite ends of an 8 mile course running towards each other. One jogger is running at a rate of 4 mph, and the other is running at a rate of 6 mph. How long will it take for the joggers to meet?

\begin{multicols}{2}
		Let $t$ represent the time it takes for the joggers to meet.  This will be the same time for each jogger.\\
		Fill in the table accordingly.
		
		\columnbreak
		
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      & \text{Rate} & \text{Time} & \text{Distance}\\
      \hline
      \text{Jogger 1} & $4$ & $t$ & $4t$\\
      \hline
      \text{Jogger 2} & $6$ & $t$ & $6t$\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
		\par
		\hspace{2.15in}\textbf{8}
    \end{multicols}
		Since the joggers will meet, their total distance will be {\bf 8} miles.\\
		\ \par
		By adding down the last column, our resulting distance equation is $4t+6t=8$.\\
		\ \par
		Solving, we get $t=\frac{4}{5}$ hours.  In other words, it will take 48 minutes for the joggers to meet.\\
